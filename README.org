    - probably more that I forgot about
** Other Stuff include ...
    - some scripts i have collected / wrote
    - a Debian based poorly written package install script
    - some files that probably should not be here
** Installation
I use stow to deploy my dotfiles you can deploy the modules you want by
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
stow <DIR> <ANOTHER DIR>
#+END_SRC
or you could use the ~stow-all~ wrapper script that stows all of the modules in
one go!
This is still an incomplete solution as you can't unstow your dotfiles using
this solution
afterwards but it should /just workâ„¢/ for deploying
** Any Questions email me here!
