** Other Stuff include ...
    - some scripts i have collected / wrote
    - a Debian based poorly written package install script
    - some files that probably should not be here
** Installation
I have written these by hand for the  most part and have not really set them up on another system so symlink them i guess. if i write an install script i will put it here
